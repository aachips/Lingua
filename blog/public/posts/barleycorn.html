        <p>There‚Äôs a book I cherish this time every year about the Autumn Equinox celebration of Mabon.</p>
        <p>The book discusses the significance of the grain harvest, and how there are many ancient references to corn and corn deities in old European writings, dating way before colonial travel to the new world. The book also explains that in old English, "corn" refers to the predominant grain in that country/region. For example, a bowl of oatmeal would be considered "corn" in old English. The newer conflation of corn with maize, which is predominantly grown on Turtle Island (North America), is likely due to American-centrism.</p>
        <p>The folk song "John Barleycorn (Must Die)" from 1780 is an allegory for the harvesting of barley to make beer. The song's violent and brutal lyrics describe the Christlike persecution and crucifixion of a man named John Barleycorn, which is simply a metaphor for the barley plant being turned into hops, and then beer..</p>
        <blockquote>
            ‚ÄúThere were three men came out of the West
            Their fortunes for to try
            And these three men made a solemn vow:
            <a href="https://genius.com/3330793/Traffic-john-barleycorn-must-die/John-barleycorn-must-die">John Barleycorn must die</a><br>
            They've ploughed, they've sown, they've harrowed him in
            Threw clods upon his head
            And these three men made a solemn vow:
            John Barleycorn was dead‚Äù

        <p>Droughts and higher heat patterns threaten grain production, which is, like the stuff we make beer with? ü§ó</p><br>
        <p>‚ÄúIt's getting harder to grow coffee, tea, and grapes for wine on a hotter planet ‚Äî and now researchers say, climate change may be coming for your IPA. A new study out Tuesday found drought and higher temperatures will lead to a decrease in the quality and quantity of hops, the aromatic plants that give beer its flavor.‚Äù</p><br>
