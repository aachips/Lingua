<p>Did you know big mats of hair can
    be used for oil spill clean ups? That can both be things like crude
    petroleum, or oil-based pollutants. Here's a video with the proof of
    concept. There are groups and even now a couple of non-profits, that
    will collect hair donations from barbershops, compress the hair into
    booms, and send them to spill relief efforts. There are also some native
    wetland plants like Cattails that can absorb thousands of times their
    own mass in heavy metals in the surrounding area. They are generally
    edible, but if they were eaten from somewhere polluted be eating all
    those concentrated metals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also charcoal, which you get as a
    byproduct from woodfires, is a great sponge for neutralizing so many
    poison agents that having a pill containing activated charcoal may be a
    helpful emergency response when someone is having a toxic reaction to
    poison, or about to. That can be used to neutralize poison agents in an
    ecosystem and be diluted into the water, or used to improve the air
    quality, or even be used as fertilizer and be helpful in soil
    restoration.
